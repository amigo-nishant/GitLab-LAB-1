A simple example of a calculator website using Node.js, Express.js, HTML, and JavaScript. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment**
Before we start coding, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

**Step 2: Create a Project Directory**
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using your terminal or command prompt.

**Step 3: Initialize Your Node.js Project**
Run the following command to create a package.json file and follow the prompts to set up your project.

npm init

**Step 4: Install Express.js**
Install the Express.js framework, which will help us create our web server.

npm install express --save

**Step 5: Create Your Server File**
Create a JavaScript file (e.g., server.js) to set up your server using Express.js.

**Step 6: Create a Public Directory**

**Step 7: Create an HTML File**
Inside the public directory, create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) for your calculator website.

**Step 8: Create a JavaScript File**
Inside the public directory, create a JavaScript file (e.g., calculator.js) for handling calculator logic.

**Step 9: Start Your Node.js Server**
Go back to your project directory and start your Node.js server.

node server.js

Your server should now be running on http://localhost:3000. Open a web browser and navigate to that URL to see your Node.js calculator website.
